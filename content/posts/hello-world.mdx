Welcome, program.

This is the first post on my new site. I’ll share project breakdowns, engineering notes, and the occasional deep dive into tools and techniques.

- Projects live under the Projects tab with case studies.
- Blog posts are written in MDX, so I can embed components when needed.

Stay tuned.
